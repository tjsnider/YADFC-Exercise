##Specifics##

###1. For performance's sake, process in parallel where possible###

###2. Use realistic food/water/resource consumption where possible###

Realistic consumption implies a realistic--if not real-world accurate--time, distance, activity, and unit-of-measure scales. 
It would be nice to be real-world accurate whenever possible, but accurate doesn't always aid playability. 
Also, having mythical creatures presupposes a certain looseness of interpretation to the term "accurate" anyway.

Would metric units help? Let's assume they do.

Things that are real:
--24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute.
--Pre-modern, agrarian societies ate more than three meals per day.(YADFC presumes a pre-modern, agrarian societal structure.)
--One's dietary needs are met by calories and nutrients, not simple volume of food eaten.
